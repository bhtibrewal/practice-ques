I tried solving the questions which I found were chalenging(due to time constraint)
I have solved them with React in Codesandbox but u can use the concepts in vanillajs also.

ps: Do tell me if you find any issue or a optimized solution.
Feel free to contact me if you find anything difficult to understand or help with any other question.
